# Internal Components
A collection of HTML-generating functions used internally by various Donut Team web services.

This library isn't really designed for general use but, regardless, its code has been made available in case it is helpful to others.

**Note**: As such, any breaking changes we make *WILL* happen without warning and probably without a major version bump. We strongly recommend that you do not directly depend on this package and only use it as a reference point.
